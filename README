This directory is a fork of
  https://github.com/jenkinsci/valgrind-plugin

The fork was made on 20Feb2013 so that rrh@newrelic.com could make
a jenkins plugin that understood the output of helgrind.  With 2
different plugins, we can separately monitor helgrind and valgrind
issues in the same job.  The downside is code divergence in this
plugin.
